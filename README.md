## Because You Needed Another RSS Reader, Obviously

Welcome to the most unnecessarily simple RSS reader you'll ever encounter. While everyone else is busy building "full-stack AI-powered blockchain-integrated RSS solutions with microservices architecture," we're over here reading XML from a GitHub Gist and spitting out HTML files like it's 1999.

### What This Abomination Does

1. **Reads RSS feeds from a GitHub Gist** - Because storing a list of URLs in a proper database would be too mainstream. Why use PostgreSQL when you can abuse GitHub's API for free hosting?

2. **Generates Static HTML** - That's right. No React. No Vue. No Angular. No SPA. No SSR. No ISR. No hydration. No bundlers. No build step that takes 10 minutes. Just plain, boring, fast HTML that actually works without 500MB of node_modules.

3. **That's It** - Seriously, that's the whole thing. No user authentication. No comments section. No analytics. No tracking. No cookies. No GDPR banners. No newsletter popup. No "download our app" nag screen. Just RSS feeds and HTML.

### Why Would Anyone Use This?

Great question. Here are some terrible reasons:

- You're tired of RSS readers that require you to create an account
- You hate modern web development with a burning passion
- You think JavaScript frameworks are overrated (they are)
- You want to host your RSS feeds on GitHub Pages because you're cheap (relatable)
- You believe in the healing power of static files
- You've finally accepted that RSS never died, your favorite websites just gave up on it

### Features We DON'T Have

- AI-powered feed recommendations (just... no)
- ocial media integration (why would you want this?)
- Cloud sync (it's literally on GitHub, git pull)
- Mobile apps (use a browser, it's 2025)
- Premium subscription tier (everything is free because it costs nothing to run)
- Dark mode toggle (edit the CSS yourself, you're welcome)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Install dependencies (there are like 2 of them)
go mod download

# and then
go for yout self
```

Congratulations, you now have HTML files. Deploy them to any static host from 2008.

### Configuration

Edit your GitHub Gist with your RSS feeds. Yes, manually. No, we don't have a GUI. No, we won't build one. Use a text editor like an adult.

### Performance

It's fast. Really fast. Know why? Because we don't do anything fancy. No database queries. No API calls except fetching the RSS feeds. No server-side rendering. No client-side hydration. Just files. Beautiful, static, cacheable files.

### Contributing

If you want to add features, please reconsider. This project's main feature is its lack of features. 

But if you insist:
- Keep it simple
- No JavaScript frameworks
- No databases
- No authentication systems
- No "just one more dependency"

### License

Do whatever you want with this. Seriously. Take it. Modify it. Sell it. I don't care. It's so simple you could rewrite it in an hour anyway.
