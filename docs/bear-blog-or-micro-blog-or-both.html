    <h2> Bear blog or Micro.blog, or both?</h2>

    <p>I got an email with a question about my choice of blogging platforms. The reader asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw you’re on Bear Blog now. Do I remember correctly that you were on Micro.blog before? Can you tell me a little bit about where you see the pros and cons, and why you chose Bear now?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The short answer: I’m on both.</p>
<p>This blog, <a href="https://robertbirming.com">robertbirming.com</a>, is hosted on <a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear</a>. I use it for longer posts and tinkering. Mostly for my public theme, <a href="https://robertbirming.com/bearming/">Bearming</a>.</p>
<p>My other blog, <a href="https://birming.com">birming.com</a>, is hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>. I use that one for shorter, title-less posts, photos, book tracking, and similar things. It’s a bit like a social media account, but with much more control over the content.</p>
<p>I really like this current setup. To me, it’s the best of two worlds.</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of back and forth between platforms to land here. Plenty of testing, a few “Heureka!” moments, and a bunch of doubts. Small doubts still pop up every now and then, but I think that’s something almost every blogger feels from time to time.</p>
<p>Personally, my creativity comes in waves. Same thing when it comes to being social online. Using both platforms fits my personality in that sense.</p>
<p>I like Bear for its simplicity when it comes to design and tweaking things. I like Micro.blog for its flexibility, and for the way it lets you follow people without turning it into a follower-count contest. Both platforms have great communities and are my number one go-tos for discovering new content.</p>
<p>Another thing I like about my current setup is that it’s possible to integrate the two. Bear is wonderful for publishing blog posts, but not as practical when it comes to shorter status updates or photo albums. With this setup, I can display my <a href="https://robertbirming.com/notes/">notes</a> and <a href="https://robertbirming.com/photos/">photos</a> from Micro.blog directly on my Bear blog, seamlessly.</p>
<p>Those are some of the main reasons I prefer this solution. What works for you, only you know.</p>
<p>It’s easy to read about other people’s pros and cons and try to decide based on that. I’ve done that many times. In reality, it rarely works. Blogging is too personal for a one-fits-all manual.</p>
<p>If I were to name one single reason for picking the “right” platform(s), it would be this:</p>
<p>Blogging should feel fun and easy.</p>
