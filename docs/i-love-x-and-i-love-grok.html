    <p>Almost 2 years, I have deleted all my other accounts and have almost completely stopped using any social media, except for X.</p>
<p>With <strong>X</strong>, it is truly a platform unlike any other.<br />
Talented, energetic, outstanding, and fascinating people gather here in dense concentration.<br />
They share their lives, work, thoughts, memories, perspectives, and journeys, frequently and relentlessly.<br />
The individuals having the greatest impact, wielding the most influence, and pushing humanity forward are often on X.<br />
They debate, they nitpick, they argue fiercely (sometimes &quot;fight&quot;), they create historic moments, and they grow together.<br />
All of them,<br />
Directly, indirectly, loudly, and even silently as quiet observers.</p>
<p>With <strong>Grok</strong>, the platform resonates even more powerfully.<br />
I use Grok far more often than I ever imagined I would. Whenever I come across an interesting post, I instinctively turn to Grok to expand it.<br />
Cultural differences?<br />
Language barriers?<br />
Not fully understanding the issue?<br />
Missing the bigger picture?<br />
Context?<br />
Fake news?<br />
Is it real?<br />
What’s the deeper meaning?<br />
What surrounds it?<br />
What’s the underlying foundation?<br />
Everything, around a topic, a post, a debate, an event, a milestone,...<br />
Grok expands it all, weaving in related trends, general news, and diverse angles to create a surprisingly rich and addictive loop of discovery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through this X+Grok loop, I stay endlessly curious, like a child, constantly asking questions, thinking deeply, and learning more things that I previously didn’t even know I didn’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is something no other platform can offer right now.<br />
X and Grok are two steps ahead, and they’ve always stayed two steps ahead.</p>
<p>I hope this remains true for many decades to come.<br />
I offer my deepest thanks, and my deepest appreciation.</p>
<p>It’s truly fortunate that Elon Musk acquired it more than three years ago.</p>
<p><strong>I love X, and I love Grok.</strong></p>
