    <p>the bathroom sink collapsed. coming home from the gym, late night—9ish on a thursday. tired but was quite in awe of the view, the image took awhile to register. the white washbasin flipped upside down, all the sinktop clutter is now floor clutter. i found that the cheap faux marble top was heavy like the real thing; the extended backsplash remained intact though. some glass shards from the diffuser scattered across the blue tiles, the blue bathroom smelt real good since.</p>
<p>around midnight, the rest of the backsplash crashed down on the kmart plastic shelf organiser, knocked down and cracked. more clutter. found some face mask that was never used.</p>

<p>it has been a couple of months now since i’ve started at this new job. a menial one just like the one before.</p>
<p>but i quite like menial jobs. i clock in, i clock out. that's it. it doesn't follow me home or stay on my mind except maybe the <a href="tab:https://youtu.be/Mr8fVT_Ds4Q?si=IGpADnc5R-bJcnaO">tetris effect</a> of it all[and i do get them quite a bit, more amusing though than annoying].</p>
<p>what i really like about menial job though are the daydreams. the available recreational brain activity really works for me. i be pondering, planning, big big plans, big big dreams. the time goes by fast on the job. i like being in my head.</p>
<p>but the body is tired at the end of the day. my feet hurts from standing all day and i got no energy because i’m trying to lose some kilos.</p>
<p>so not a lot of forward momentum happening with all these ruminating, planning, taking over the world ideas. my drafts for somethings are out of control.</p>

<p>what are you coping from?</p>
<p>i think mine is my childhood. not necessarily because i had a bad one. i think i had a solid upbringing. i just wish i put a little bit more effort into everything. i wish that i learned earlier that fear is the mind killer.</p>
<p>i wish i <del>lived</del>failed more. realising that at twentyfive, it feels like a blessing, and yet, i feel like that’s still a lot of life that i’ve missed.</p>
<p>so now there's been this tug and pull that i’ve been feeling about optimisation/productivity. i feel like i want a version of my life to live in this rigid, structured schedule. but at the same time, i just want a version where i just go with the flow, freedom of movement, no guardrails. idk. i think i’m starting to settle something in between, like living with a mantra or litany, northstar of sorts. i’m desperate for a purpose.</p>
<p>i think i want a religion.</p>

<p>it is lonesome here, most times—sometimes, but lonesome is just that, it’s sad, maybe even depressing, but it’s also calm and cozy, relaxing solitude, dare i say a bit exciting, like my own little secret. but not a realreal secret. the door is open for those who find it, it’s just me here. no pressure. no shame. no lies. just [packaged]honesty.</p>
<p>i like it here.</p>
