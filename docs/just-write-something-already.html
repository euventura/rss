    <p>We were doing research for a Lady Arcaders project the other day and happened to come across a blog post from 2005. We clicked through the blog and found out that the person who posted it is still blogging <strong>twenty years later</strong> on the same website. That’s wild, man.</p>
<p>I wrote a letter (yes physical mail) two weeks ago that I had been putting off for 8 months because I was too anxious to just sit down and write. What things do I choose to write about to someone in only a few pages that summarizes the last 8 months? Things are in constant motion. When I’d write something down, it’d change next week.  I guess it would have been less daunting if I had just replied right away.</p>
<p>It’s a lot more scary to put yourself out there online in current year. I think about how I have 20 year old DM conversations on Twitter with people who I haven’t talked to in years, I really should delete the account but I cant bring myself to do it. I love data archival but it’s all being tainted by the fact that the information is being scraped and sold. I hate it here.</p>
<p>The internet has changed a lot and I haven’t had a place to talk about my thoughts since LiveJournal was a thing. Even when cohost was a thing I was using it as more of a social site. I like what Bear Blog is doing with their small discovery feed, I love stuff like Neocities’ website directory. Crawling the internet and finding random snippets of people’s lives that you’re not connected to in any way. It’s cool. I’ve been looking for more small communities websites like that, and thinking about how to bring that old internet feeling back in small pockets.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess what I’m saying is that I should write more and stop thinking so much about it.</p>
