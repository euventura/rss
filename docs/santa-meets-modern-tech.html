    <p>My nephew still believes in Santa, and he thinks this mysterious figure is one of the most awesome dudes around.</p>
<p>My sister is doing everything she can to keep that dream alive. She sneaks into his room and rearranges things, pours flour outside his door to make tiny footsteps, puts out a bowl of porridge and makes sure Santa has suddenly eaten it, and leaves small gifts here and there.</p>
<p>There are traces everywhere, but the secret Santa is nowhere to be seen. It's a mystery, and it makes my nephew a bit frustrated. He wants to meet him, or at least catch a glimpse.</p>
<p>So what do you do in the year 2025?</p>
<p>His solution is as genius as it is obvious if you are born into these tech times. A motion-activated camera. This year, the secret Santa Claus fellow won’t stay a mystery for long.</p>
<p>I don’t know how my sister will work it out. All I know is that even Santa is having a hard time surviving in the digital age.</p>
