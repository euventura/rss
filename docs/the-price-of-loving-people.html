    <p>—is mourning them in advance, even when nothing is wrong. Sometimes it's fear: growing up and around it, living every day and knowing it's still part of me.</p>
<p>It will always be a part of me, that fear, for as long as we are both alive, the same blood cycling back and forth in our tired veins.</p>
<p>Sometimes loving you is very easy, and sometimes it's automatically converting to your time zone, and wondering what you're doing, and waiting like a dog for you to wake up. Sometimes it's crying a little at 3 a.m. over something that happened more than half a decade ago.</p>
<p>Sometimes I talk to myself in our chat like if I could talk enough, I could talk myself into a house in California. Half the world away. It would be sunny, and the sky would be a different shade of blue, and I wouldn't have to wonder anymore.</p>
