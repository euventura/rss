    <p>Heya!<br />
It's been a while!<br />
I've been busy with quite a lot of stuff these past few weeks - which is what this post will be about!</p>
<p>First of all, there's obviously christmas, and the gazette calendar leading up to it. I've only just now really gotten the time to actually read most of the posts lol - I'll probably be going through them all either today or tomorrow, we'll see.</p>
<p>There's also the gazette book club... I have yet to finish the book we're reading xd.</p>
<p>I'm cutting it a tad close here I'll admit, but I'm still fairly confident i can get that done this month. If not, maybe I'll submit a day or two late. Who knows.</p>
<p>Anyways! Onto some more positive news! I've actually been working on a guestbook website that'll get released... Sometime soon, hopefully? Depends on when I'm done with the thing, but I am making good progress. The idea is to just have something self-hostable that doesn't have as many of the trust issues ava and Archaeopteryx brought up in their respective blogposts. So, easy account deletion, a privacy policy, multiple fast ways to export your data, decent moderation tools and captcha support, decent privacy, and a way to self-host it, in case you don't trust me being in charge of your data. In general, I'm just trying to make it something I would be comfortable using. As I said, I'm still very much in the weeds of development, and once I gotta get back to my job, progress will slow down quite dramatically. I'm hoping to get it done before then? But, no promises obviously. We'll see. Maybe I'll do a few devlog style posts on here or something, who knows.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I've been doing kind of a ton of stuff! Between that, this blog, and like... Actual real-life obligations, that'll probably mean some less frequent posts on here. Oh well, such is life. I've already made well over a 100 blogposts, so personally I'm fine with things slowing down a little bit, even though i do wish i had more time to properly do everything that i want to.<br />
Welp, that's that.<br />
Cya next post!<br />
Oh, right, I'm also still learning japanese on the side, so there's that too. Forgot to mention that. I have too much stuff going on lol.</p>
