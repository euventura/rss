    <p>My beautiful grandmother, who recently turned 92, has gone through hell over the last three to four months. She went from someone who has lived alone a good portion of her life (her husband died early), who walked one to two miles a day to the store with groceries, to church, the bank, and everywhere in between, to completely falling apart.</p>
<p>She has congestive heart failure and had a pacemaker put in a few years back. About four months ago, skin cancer on her head had to be scraped out, which resulted in what was essentially a softball-sized hole that was many inches deep in her head. My mom had to clean it twice per day, along with a nurse who came a few times a week. It was incredibly difficult for my mom and for my immediate family, as we all have decided to live close by over the years. When my mom or the nurse couldn’t do it, I would.</p>
<p>After she finally recovered from that, she just wasn’t the same. She was breathing heavily, with fluid building up around her heart due to the congestive heart failure faster than before, which landed her back in the hospital for a couple of weeks. Again, incredibly difficult for her and for my immediate family, my mom, dad, sister, myself, and one of my cousins who lives about an hour away and has spent a considerable amount of time with her as well. We are essentially her caregivers (with my mom doing the most over the years), and we love her very much.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks in the hospital, she was moved to a just-okay-but-pretty-depressing rehab facility about 30 minutes away. They did physical therapy with her and tried to get her used to her new reality using a walker and doing much less than she once could. When she was finally released, my mom spent many days and nights at the house taking care of her (Nana). My sister, dad, cousin, and I also spent a lot of time there. We hired a part-time nurse to help for a few hours most days, but it just wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>One morning, she walked to the bathroom, completely passed out, and fell forward off the toilet and landed straight on her head. When she tried to stand up, she fell back and cracked the back of her head open (somehow slicing it down the middle as well), creating an incredibly large wound (and fractured her wrist). She was rushed to Zuckerberg Hospital about an hour later, where the trauma unit spent over five hours doing their best to stitch her back up.</p>
<p>During that time, she completely lost consciousness while my sister, mom, and the surgeon were in the room, and they were convinced they had lost her. Somehow, she came back. She was confused, but okay.</p>
<p>After the surgeons did the best they could, think softball-sized openings again just shy of the brain, that had to be closed, the nurse let her go to the bathroom. During that visit, my grandmother again passed out and began to fall forward. Her eyes were wide open, but nobody was there. My mom was in the bathroom and grabbed her (likely saved her life), while my sister and I rushed in to help hold her up. Thankfully, she woke back up.</p>
<p>Now, after a week at Zuckerberg Hospital, she’s spent the last few days back at the same depressing rehab center, sharing a room with another patient. The food is gross and she won’t eat it. The patient next to her is coughing nonstop, and these facilities are prone for pneumonia. My grandmother is still mostly all there mentally, which makes it even harder. She’s sad and depressed.</p>
<p>She doesn’t read much or watch much TV. She moved here from Malta at a very young age, and although she speaks English, you have to keep things simple when talking to her. Reading has always been tough, but she does her best. She doesn’t have many hobbies to pass the time. When she was healthy, her life was filled with hanging out with friends and family, walking daily, Church, and taking care of her house with her 50+ plants and trees.</p>
<p>Now the time has come for her to leave rehab, and there are only a few options. The barometer for the decision should be simple, treat someone the way you would want to be treated in the same situation.</p>
<p>The options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>24-hour care at home</li>
<li>She moves in with one of the three sisters</li>
<li>One of the three sisters moves in with her</li>
<li>Moving to a boujee assisted living facility</li>
<li>Moving to a just-okay assisted living facility</li>
</ol>
<p>At the moment, option five was decided from the sisters, and it's not the decision I would have made. Many people who move into these not-so-nice assisted living facilities only make it a handful of months. They stop eating the gross food (my grandmother already showed resilience of the food at the rehab center), don’t get out of bed much, and ultimately lose the will to live.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly grateful that I decided to leave Austin, Texas in 2024. I wanted to be within a 10-minute drive of my immediate family and my grandmother. I’m so thankful that I get to spend as much time with her as I do.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaways for me from all of this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saying you love someone is easy. Showing up, consistently, when it’s uncomfortable and exhausting, is what actually counts.</li>
<li>Talk with your parents EARLY about what they want if assisted living ever becomes necessary (moving in with you, you moving in with them, at-home care, boujee assisted living, or not-so-boujee assisted living.)</li>
<li>Always show up for people. Always show your love.</li>
</ol>
<p>To my immediate family and one of my cousins, I’m very proud of the love and support we’ve shown over the many years with Nana. I pray she lives a very long time.</p>
